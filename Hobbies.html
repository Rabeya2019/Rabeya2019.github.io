	<h1><b><i>My Hobbies</i></b></h1>
	<br>
	<p>During my spare time I practice my hobbies. I am more into art. I like to do sketches and colored pictures. I have an interest in painting but I did not practice much. I also like listening to music. I listen to the radio very often. I also have a rare practice of composing poetries. I like to watch movies, especially animation-movies.</p>
